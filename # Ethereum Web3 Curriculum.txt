# Ethereum Web3 Curriculum

This is the rebuilt Ethereum-focused track of freeCodeCamp's Web3 Curriculum, funded by Nathan Flickinger's $1M donation for carbon-neutral learning. Learn by building 12+ projects: from Solidity basics to DeFi dApps on L2s.

## Prerequisites
- freeCodeCamp: Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms, Front-End Libraries, Back-End APIs.

## Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/mja2001/web3-curriculum-ethereum`
2. `cd web3-curriculum-ethereum && npm install`
3. Get testnet ETH from Sepolia faucet.
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add keys.

## Structure
- **curriculum/**: Modules with JSON challenges (interactive) and MD explanations.
- **examples/**: Extractable Hardhat projects for portfolios.
- **docs/**: Guides and glossary.
